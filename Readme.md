# About A Code About Blog

As you may guess from the name, this is a reversal of the normal blog paradigm where we have words about code. Here we will have code about words. In the tradition of [homoiconic][1], I'll be putting code folders up here as complete projects along with a blog post describing its design and operation.

This is just an experiment for now, but hopefully I put a few things up here soon.
